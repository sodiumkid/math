Because of this, when considering which terms go towards infinity faster we can only consider the term with the highest degree.",

      "Content" : `There are multiple ways to find limits to infinity. One way is to ignore all digits except for the most significant digit of the numerator and the denominator. This is because as the value for x increases, the other less significant digits become less and less important. From this point, you can follow a few simple rules: \n - If the power of the numerator is larger than the power of the denominator, lim x->∞ of f(x) = ∞. \n - If the power of the numerator is smaller than the power of the denominator, lim x->∞ of f(x) = 0. \n - If the power of the numerator and denominator are equal, lim x->∞ of f(x) is equal the the coefficient of the highest power digit of the numerator divided by the coefficient of the highest power digit of denominator`,

We need to investigate further whether the numerator or the denominator approaches zero faster and/or if the terms leading to the indeterminate form can be eliminated. \n When direct substitution will lead to the so called indeterminate form, factoring of the numerator and reducing will be the way to solve.",
